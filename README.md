# Deploy your PyWebIO app to cloud platform

## GAE

### Config your app

First, configure all dependencies you will need for your web service in your `requirements.txt` file.

To deploy your web service to App Engine, you need an `app.yaml` file. This configuration file defines your web service's settings for Google App Engine.

In general, the configuration you need is as follows:

```yaml
runtime: python39
entrypoint: python3 app.py --port=$PORT
```
The entrypoint field specifics how to start your app. You need replace `app.py` with your start script, and your app should listen on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable.

### Create GAE project
Go [Google Cloud App Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine), and create a new project.

### Open Cloud Shell
Open Cloud Shell by clicking the Activate Cloud Shell button in the navigation bar in the upper-right corner of the console.

### Get app code

In Cloud Shell, enter the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wang0618/pywebio-in-cloud.git
```

### Deploying with Cloud Shell
To deploy your app enter the following:

```bash
cd pywebio-in-cloud
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project pywebio-demo
```

### Visit your app

To view your application in the web browser run:
```bash
gcloud app browse
```

Then you will get a link to your app.

NOTE:
 - The standard environment of GAE doesn't support websocket, so you need to use `pywebio.platform.tornado_http.start_server()` or `pywebio.platform.flask.start_server()` or `pywebio.platform.django.start_server()` to start server which communicates with the browser using HTTP protocol. The flexible environment does support websocket, but it has no free quota. For more info, see https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/the-appengine-environments
 - If you just want to use the free quota of GAE and don't want to be charged, go to the [Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects) to disable billing
 - To delete the project, see https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects


## Heroku

### Config your app

Like GAE, you need configure all dependencies for your web service in your `requirements.txt` file.

To deploy your web service to Heroku, you need a `Procfile` file. This configuration file defines your web service's settings for Heroku.

In general, the configuration you need is as follows:

```yaml
web: python app.py --port=$PORT
```
The `Procfile` file specifics how to start your app. You need replace `app.py` with your start script, and your app should listen on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable.

Note: Heroku does support websocket, but it will [close idle connections](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/websockets#timeouts) (i.e., if no data is sent in 55 seconds then the connection is terminated). You need to provide `websocket_ping_interval` parameter in `start_server()` (e.g., `start_server(main, port=8080, websocket_ping_interval=30)`) to prevent the connection from idling by sending ping packet periodically over the connection.
